This file contains the project for TDT4145 developed by David Rozas Domingo and Miguel Bono Tur (Group 17).

It consists of:
- bin: executable file. To execute it just run java -jar PicturesDB.jar
- src: source code.
- scripts: scripts used to create tables and insert data (adapted to derby from last version)
- doc: changes to the documentation due to the implementation

The project was developed under GNU Ubuntu Linux 8.04 and tested sucessfully over W32 systems. We have tried to avoid any kind of dependencie with the OS (ex.: slashs in the paths). Anyway if there is an incompatibility problem, please let us know at: david.rozas@gmail.com or mibotu@fiv.upv.es
